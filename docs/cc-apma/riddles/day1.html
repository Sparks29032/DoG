	<summary>Crazy 8s: Using only addition, add eight 8s together to get the number 1000.</summary>
	<p>> 888 + 88 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 1000.</p>

	<summary>Not adding up: I add six to eleven, and get five.</summary>
	<p>> Six hours after 11am is 5pm (or six hours after 11pm is 5am).</p>

	<summary> A lot of thought:<br>

	<p>> The car is parked on lot number 87. Turn the image upside-down.</p>

	<summary>Wholly confusing: A machine takes in and spits out numbers following a certain rule. I feed 36 into the machine and it spits out 1. Putting in 20, 59, and 265 both also give 1. Putting in 81 gives 2, 892 gives 3, and 71928375 gives 3. Finally, I put in 121315171 and it gives 0. What is the rule the machine is following?</summary>
	<p>> The machine spits out the number of "holes" in the number. Every 0, 6, and 9 contribute one. Every 8 contributes two. Every 1, 2, 5, and 7 contribute zero. We avoid 4 since, depending on the font, it may have one or no holes!</p>
