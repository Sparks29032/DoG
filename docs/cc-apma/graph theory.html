Graphs Fundamentals
</h1>

<h2>
Definitions
</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <b>vertex</b> is a point in space.</li>
<li>We can draw a segment between two vertices <var>u</var> and <var>v</var>, (not necessarily distinct). 
This segment is called an <b>edge</b>. If <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> are the same, the edge is called a <b>loop</b>. 
Two edges that both have <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> as endpoints are considered <b>parallel</b>. 
Two edges sharing only a single endpoint are called <b>adjacent</b>.</li>
<li>A <b>graph</b> is a collection of vertices and edges. 
The <b>order</b> of a graph is how many vertices it has. 
<b>Simple graphs</b> are graphs without loops or parallel edges. 
Graphs are <b>homeomorphically irreducible</b> when no vertex has two edges. This is because the structure of the graph is not fundamentally changed if we remove vertices with two edges.</li>
<li>Two vertices on a graph are considered <b>connected</b> if there is a sequence of adjacent edges we can traverse to get from one vertex to the other.
The sequence of edges we traverse between two vertices is called a <b>path</b>.
If there is a path between any pair of vertices on a graph, that graph is considered <b>connected</b>.</li>
<li><b>Cycles</b> are paths from a vertex to itself with at least one edge traversed.</li>
<li>Graphs without cycles have special names. If they are connected, they are called <b>trees</b>. If they are not connected (disconnected), they are <b>forests</b>.</li>
<li>Finally, let us define a notion of "equality" for graphs, known as <b>isomorphism</b>. In a hand-wavy sense, graphs are isomorphic if their edges connect vertices in the same way. 
We can call graphs <b>distinct</b> when they are not isomorphic to each other. 
The process for determining isomorphisms is a bit complicated:
<ol>
  <li>Check if the two graphs have the same amount of vertices. If they do not, they are distinct.</li>
  <li>Label each vertex in one graph <var>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ...</var>. Then, try to pair each vertex <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> to a unique 
  vertex from the other graph <var>y<sub>i</sub></var> such that if <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>x<sub>j</sub></var> have an edge, so do 
  <var>y<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>y<sub>j</sub></var>. Similarly, if there is no edge between <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>x<sub>j</sub></var>, 
  then there is no edge between <var>y<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>y<sub>j</sub></var>. If no such pairing exist, the graphs are distinct.</li>
  <li>However, if such a pairing can be found, these graphs are isomorphic.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>
Good Will Hunting (Pt 1)
</h2>
A pop-culture problem involving graph theory comes from <i>Good Will Hunting</i> where Professor Lambeau asks his students to 
"[d]raw all the [distinct] homeomorphically irreducible trees with [order] 10". Based on our definitions above, we should be able to find all ten.

Though Professor Lambeau mentions the notorious difficulty of this problem, we can see after our exploration of graph theory that it is not so hard!

<h2>
Adjacency Matrices
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graphs can get messy, but we can represent their information nicely in a matrix. Given a graph <var>G</var> with <var>V</var> vertices labeled from <var>1</var> to <var>V</var>, 
the <b>adjacency matrix</b> of the graph is a <var>V&Cross;V</var> matrix <var>A</var> where <var>A<sub>i,j</sub></var> is the number of edges between 
vertex <var>i</var> and vertex <var>j</var>. Note that an adjacency matrix is always a square symmetric matrix.</li>

<li>Each entry of the adjacency matrix encodes the number of one-edge paths there are between two vertices. 
Since the adjacency matrix is square, we can take powers of it. For any positive integer <var>n</var>, entries in <var>A<sup>n</sup></var> 
represent the number of <var>n</var>-edge paths between two vertices. For instance, entry <var>[A<sup>n</sup>]<sub>i,j</sub></var> 
is the number of paths between vertex <var>i</var> and vertex <var>j</var> involving exactly <var>n</var> edges.</li>
</ul>

Good Will Hunting (Pt 2)
</h2>
Revisiting <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, the professor earlier asked his class to find the adjacency matrix of the following graph.
<center><img src="resources/images/goodwill-graph.png" alt="goodwill-graph.png" width=40% height=auto></center>
Additionally, he wanted them to find the matrix giving the number of <var>3</var>-step walks (paths involving three edges).

<h2>
Bridges of Königsberg
</h2>
The mathmatician Euler puzzled over the Prussian city of Königsberg, wondering how one could cross each of the seven bridges (on the map below) exactly once.
<center><img src="resources/images/konigsberg-map.png" alt="konigsberg-map.png" width=80% height=auto></center>
Can you find a way to do so?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>> Sorry, it's impossible! However, during WWII, the city was bombed, causing two of the bridges to be destroyed. 
Now, Königsberg has been renamed Kaliningrad. A recent map of Kaliningrad (rendered in 2023) is below. 
<center><img src="resources/images/kaliningrad-map.png" alt="kaliningrad-map.png" width=80% height=auto></center>
Now another question: can you cross these remaining five bridges exactly once?</p>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>> Here's how you could cross these five bridges on your next vacation:

<h2>
Special Paths
</h2>
There are four particularly special types of paths.
<ul>
<li>An <b>Eulerian path</b> is a path that uses every edge in a graph exactly once.</li>
<li>Similarly, an <b>Eulerian cycle</b> is a cycle that uses every edge in a graph exactly once.</li>
<li>A path where each vertex on the graph is an endpoint to exactly two edges is called a <b>Hamiltonian cycle</b>.</li>
<li>Instead, a <b>Hamiltonian path</b> has two vertices as endpoints to exactly one edge while all the rest are endpoints to two.</li>
</ul>
In both Eulerian paths and cycles, all edges of a graph are included in the path. 
In both Hamiltonian paths and cycles, all vertices are endpoints of edges on the path.

<h2>
Directed Graphs
</h2>
<ul>
<li>So far, the graphs we have talked about are <b>undirected</b>, meaning if an edge exists between vertex <var>i</var> and <var>j</var>, we can travel from 
<var>i</var> to <var>j</var> and vice-versa. However, on a <b>directed graph</b>, edges specify a single direction of travel. For instance, we can 
now have an edge pointing from <var>i</var> to <var>j</var>, indicating we can travel from <var>i</var> to <var>j</var>, but not the other way around.</li>
<li>Adjacency matrices for directed graphs may no longer be symmetric. Now, the <var>i,j</var>-th entry of an adjacency matrix is the number of 
edges that point from <var>i</var> to <var>j</var> specifically.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>
Challenge: Finding Special Paths (Pt 2)
</h2>
Try to come up with a rule for when Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths/cycles exist on a directed graph. 
These may be similar to the rules you have come up with earlier.
